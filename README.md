# ‚ö°Ô∏è Flashback
Quickly compare webpage snapshots over time

## What is it?
A single-page web app that aims to present a useful and user-friendly front end to the Internet Archive's `memento` store and the Wayback Machine.

## Ok, but what is it?
Right now it's a proof-of-concept implementation in Javascript, HTML, and CSS to provide a portal into which one can scry for changes to the webpage of their choosing, first by submitting a URL, then scrubbing a slider back and forth through time.

## What does it look like?
Ah, that's a different question altogether. It has a simple interface that looks like this:

## How do I use it?
 1. Download [flashback.html](flashback.html).
 2. Open it in your browser.
 3. ...
 4. Profit?

## Cool, but it's slow
That's not a question. But you're right. A less na√Øve implementation would render all the snapshots to canvas and swap through them in memory. See <sup>1</sup> below.

## Great, but why doesn't it do X
Because I made it to solve a specific need, in a short period of time. File an issue with your request, or, better yet, a PR with your changes.

## TODO
 0. Tested extensively in Safari. Need to test on other browsers and platforms.
 1. <sup>1</sup> Make it snappy. ü´°
 2. Make resource loading robust across snapshots. üó∫Ô∏è<br /><em>This will involve mapping each linked resource on a page to a set of snapshots in which that resource is available, so that when a snapshot fails to cache said resource, we can substitute the closest-in-time archived version of it instead.</em>
 4. Work around `localStorage` limit of 5MB. üíæ
 5. Support other `memento` providers besides the Internet Archive (see [RFC 7809](https://mementoweb.org/guide/rfc/), also check out [other memento tools](https://mementoweb.org/tools/)). üßë‚Äçüíª

## If you like this project
If you think this is useful, thanks! I appreciate it. I think it's useful too. Please show your support by [donating to the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/donate), without which we would literally have lost decades of digital culture (and without whose shoulders this project would have nothing to stand upon).
